# War Room design

Purpose: expose the loopback operator UI/API for status, approvals, chat attachment, review, recovery, and diagnostics. Interfaces are `serve`, route modules, serializers/views, authenticated human actions, and static/template assets covered by this owner. Owns `REQ-WARROOM-001` (operator actions are explicit) and `DEC-WARROOM-001` (the UI projects canonical services rather than owning state).

Evidence: `cascade/war_room/` and `tests/war_room/` at baseline `d932f48764cc0ceb2f4810cdd4487bef0c9ef084`; inventory digest `d86a5977ca42a2fd7da1ca80dc7b3251a8522f1a427e836c0abed741a816f1b6`.

Known gaps: forge descriptions unavailable in Task 001 remain explicit gaps.
