# Watchdog design

Purpose: observe canonical state, admit dependency-ready work, and coordinate bounded recovery. Interfaces are dispatch/activation, queues, poll loop, capability registry, incidents/reservations, health audit, and model resolution. Owns `REQ-WATCHDOG-001` (automation obeys lifecycle gates) and `DEC-WATCHDOG-001` (generation-bound reservations converge recovery).

Evidence: `cascade/watchdog/`, `tests/watchdog/`, and lifecycle tests at baseline `d932f48764cc0ceb2f4810cdd4487bef0c9ef084`; inventory digest `d86a5977ca42a2fd7da1ca80dc7b3251a8522f1a427e836c0abed741a816f1b6`.

Known gaps: missing receipts prevent complete work-to-commit attribution.
