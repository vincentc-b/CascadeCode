# Feature team design

Purpose: run the persistent tactical team that decomposes Features, responds to review, and coordinates Task integration. Interfaces are Feature graph/boot/wiring, guarded Task creation, publication/review polling, comments, briefing, and branch recovery. Owns `REQ-FEATURE-001` (Feature context survives Task turnover) and `DEC-FEATURE-001` (Task writes and ancestor reads are guarded).

Evidence: `cascade/feature/` and `tests/feature/` at baseline `d932f48764cc0ceb2f4810cdd4487bef0c9ef084`; inventory digest `d86a5977ca42a2fd7da1ca80dc7b3251a8522f1a427e836c0abed741a816f1b6`.

Known gaps: receipt and review evidence remains incomplete.
